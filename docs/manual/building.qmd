# Building

`i18n-check` can be configured with Cmake and then built with your compiler of choice.

On Unix:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
cmake ./
make -j4
```

On Windows, "CMakeLists.txt" can be opened and built directly in Visual Studio.

After building, "i18n-check" will then be available in the "bin" folder.
