# Working with Projects

To create a new project, click the `r keys("New")` button on the ribbon.
The **New Project** dialog will appear:

![](../images/options-dialog-source.png){width=75% fig-align="center"}

First, select which folder (or file) you wish to analysis.
If analyzing a folder, you can also optionally select folders and files within that folder that should be ignored.
Finally, select which checks to perform and which options to use and click `r keys("OK")`.
(Documentation for these options is available in ch. [-@sec-gui-settings].)

After opening or creating a project, you can reanalyze the folder at any time by clicking `r keys("Refresh")` on the ribbon.
The **Edit Project** dialog will appear, where you will be able to change any option before re-running the analysis.

When you are finished reviewing a project, click `r keys("Save")` to save it.
The project file will remember the folder you were reviewing, along with your current settings.
To reopen this project, click the `r keys("Open")` button on the ribbon and select the project file.
