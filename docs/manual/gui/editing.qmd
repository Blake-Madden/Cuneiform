# Editing

When a source file in the loaded in the editor and the editor is selected, the **Edit** section of the ribbon will become enabled.
From here, you can edit the source file in the **Editor** and make use of these options from the ribbon.

## Basic Operations

Clipboard operations (e.g., `r keys("Cut")`, `r keys("Copy")`, and `r keys("Paste")`), `r keys("Undo")`, `r keys("Redo")`, and `r keys("Select All")` are all available from this section.

## Insert

From the `r keys("Insert")` button, options are available for inserting and converting content within the editor to fix various warnings.

For example, to fix warnings about strings needing context, place the cursor into the editor in front of a resource loading call (e.g., `_("TABLE")`).
Next, click the `r keys("Insert")` button on the ribbon and select **Translator Comment...**.
Enter a comment that will explain to the translators what "TABLE" means in this context, providing guidance for how they should translate it.
Click `r keys("OK")` and your comment with "TRANSLATORS: " prefixed will be inserted in front of the function call.
("TRANSLATORS: " is the default tag that **gettext** looks for when extracting translator comments.)

This warning is emitted when the option **Check for ambiguous strings that lack a translator comment** (from the **Source Code** settings) is checked.

To fix warnings about extended ASCII characters needing to be encoded, select the text in the editor which contains these characters.
Next, click the `r keys("Insert")` button on the ribbon and select **Encode Extended ASCII Characters...**.
You will then be prompted about how the selection will be re-encoded.
Click `r keys("OK")` and the selection will be replaced with the re-encoded content.

As an example, if you have the string "Błąd" (Polish for "Error") in a source file, some legacy compilers may have difficulty processing it (even if encoded as UTF-8).
By following the aforementioned steps, this will be re-encoded to "B\\U00000142\\U00000105d."

This warning is emitted when the option **Unencoded extended ASCII characters** (from the **Additional Checks** settings) is checked.
