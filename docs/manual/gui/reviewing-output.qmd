# Reviewing Output

After opening a project, select any warning message in the top window and the associated file will be displayed beneath it.
The line where the issue was detected will be scrolled to, along with the warning shown underneath it.

![](../images/main-window.png)

From here, you can edit the file in this window to correct any issues.
Once you are finished editing, either select another file's warning in the top window or click the `r keys("Save")` button on the ribbon.
(The latter will also save the project if it has unsaved changes.)
