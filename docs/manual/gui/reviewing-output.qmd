# Reviewing Output

After opening a project, select any warning message in the top window and the associated file will be displayed beneath it.
The line where the issue was detected will be scrolled to, along with the warning shown underneath it.

From here, you can edit the file in this window to correct any issues.
Once you are finished editing, either select another file's warning in the top window or click the `r keys("Save")` button on the ribbon.
(The latter will also save the project if it has unsaved changes.)

## Ignoring Output

Specific warnings and files can be ignored from the project window.

To ignore a file, select it in the top window and click the `r keys("Ignore")` button on the ribbon.
From the menu that appears, select the **Ignore \'*fileName*\'** option (where *fileName* is the file name) and this file will be removed from the project.

To ignore a class of warnings, select a warning for any file in top window and click the `r keys("Ignore")` button on the ribbon.
From the menu that appears, select the **Ignore \'*warningId*\'** option (where *warningId* is the warning, such as "[notL10NAvailable]").
All instances of this warning will be removed from all files. Also, this check will no longer be performed when you re-run the analysis.

These options are also available by right clicking any warning and selecting them from the popup menu.

## Editing

When a warning for a source file is selected, the **Edit** section of the ribbon will become enabled.
From here, you can edit the source file in the **Editor** and use these options on the ribbon to edit it.
For example, to fix warnings about strings needing context, place the cursor into the editor in front of a resource loading call (e.g., `_("TABLE")`).
Next, click the `r keys("Insert")` button on the ribbon and select **Translator Comment**.
Enter a comment that will explain to the translators what "TABLE" means in this context, providing guidance for how they should translate it.
Click `r keys("OK")` and your comment with "TRANSLATORS: " prefixed will be inserted in front of the function call.
("TRANSLATORS: " is the default tag that **gettext** looks for when extracting translator comments.)

## Exporting Results

To export all warnings, click the `r keys("Save")` button on the ribbon and select **Export Results**.
From here, you can export the results to either a CSV or tab-delimited text file.
