# Inline Suppression

Warnings can be suppressed for blocks of source code by placing `i18n-check-suppress-begin` and `i18n-check-suppress-end` comments around them.
For example:

``` {.cpp}
// i18n-check-suppress-begin
if (_debug && allocFailed)
    AfxMessageBox("Allocation failed");
// i18n-check-suppress-end
```

This will prevent a warning from being emitted about "Allocation failed" not being available for localization.

::: {.notesection data-latex=""}
The comment style of the begin and end tags must match. For example, if using multi-line comments
(i.e., `/**/`), then both tags must be inside of `/**/` blocks.
